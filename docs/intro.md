# Cartesi Boardgame

### Introduction to Cartesi Boardgame Library

The **Cartesi Boardgame Library** is an innovative framework that transforms turn-based board game development by integrating blockchain technology for secure and transparent outcomes. Inspired by the popular Boardgame.io, this library enables developers to build digital board games effortlessly, leveraging Cartesi’s powerful infrastructure.

It simplifies game logic, state management, and player interactions within a robust, scalable environment. By utilizing Cartesi’s Virtual Machine (CVM) and Cartesify, the library introduces blockchain validation, ensuring the integrity of game moves. This approach allows complex computations to be processed off-chain, while maintaining blockchain-level security, setting a new standard for transparency in board game development.

### What is Cartesi?

[Cartesi](https://cartesi.io/) is a layer-2 platform that bridges the gap between blockchain and traditional software development. It empowers developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) using mainstream programming languages, benefiting from blockchain’s security and transparency. By enabling off-chain computation, Cartesi allows for complex logic, lower costs, and faster processing times while preserving the decentralized and trustless nature of blockchain.

### Boardgame.io Integration and Key Differences

The **Cartesi Boardgame Library** is inspired by [Boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/), retaining its intuitive structure and core features, making it easy for developers familiar with Boardgame.io to adapt. However, key differences emerge through Cartesi’s integration, introducing blockchain validation, secure storage, and randomness. These unique capabilities, explored in the Architecture section, enhance Boardgame.io's functionality, bringing new possibilities for decentralized game development.
