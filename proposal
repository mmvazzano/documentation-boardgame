Boardgame.io-Inspired Library for Cartesi

Boardgame.io is an open-source JavaScript library designed for the streamlined development of turn-based board games on the web. The framework handles game state management, and rules definition, and facilitates communication between players in a multiplayer environment. Developers can easily integrate and customize the library, which follows a client-server architecture, ensuring fairness and consistency in gameplay. While not obligatory, Boardgame.io is often used in conjunction with React for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces. In essence, it simplifies the complexities of creating web-based board games by providing a structured and extensible platform. 

We propose the development of a new game library, inspired by the proven Boardgame.io architecture, with a unique focus on seamless integration with the Cartesi blockchain. This library aims to empower game developers to create turn-based board games for the web, where game results are securely validated on the blockchain for transparency and trust. Our proposed game library, inspired by Boardgame.io, will seamlessly integrate with Cartesi to enable the execution of complex game logic in the blockchain ecosystem. This integration ensures that game results are securely recorded on the blockchain, leveraging Cartesi's computing technology for efficient and scalable processing. In line with Boardgame.io's user-friendly approach, our library will provide developers with intuitive tools to define game rules, manage state, and facilitate multiplayer interactions, fostering a seamless and accessible game development experience.

Moreover, our commitment to modern development best practices is ingrained in our approach. The proposed game library, inspired by the robust architecture of boardgame.io, fits perfectly with contemporary standards. We leverage established frameworks and cutting-edge techniques, ensuring not only the initial quality of the product but also its long-term maintainability. By emphasizing adherence to these best practices, our project aims to deliver a high-quality, reliable, and innovative solution that stands the test of time in the dynamic realm of web-based board games.

Our implementation plan is structured around achieving six key milestones, each aimed at advancing the development of the proposed game library and ensuring its successful integration with the Cartesi blockchain. These milestones are carefully designed to progressively build upon each other, culminating in the completion of a fully functional and well-documented framework ready for open-source release.
